Import the following data:

- activity_labels.txt: describe the activities
- features.txt: describe the features
- subject_test.txt/subject_train.txt: define the subjects which are in the test or train group
- X_test.txt/X_train.txt: the test or train dataset
- Y_test.txt/Y_train.txt: the activites for test or train dataset

Merge the datasets.
Take the means and the standard variations for following variables:
- tBodyAcc-XYZ
- tBodyGyro-XYZ
- fBodyAcc-XYZ
- fBodyGyro-XYZ

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

For each activity and each subject the mean is calculated.
